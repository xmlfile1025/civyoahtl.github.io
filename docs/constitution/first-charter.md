## Preamble

As time goes on, it becomes necessary for a nation to establish for itself a body of laws to ensure domestic order and the preservation of the values that define it. So too is it for Yoahtl, which has for almost a decade now existed without a charter to define its government and protect its core - that all people, regardless of origin, beliefs, politics, or characteristics, are welcome and accepted here, so long as they work for the betterment of the community as a whole.

## Outline

The government shall be maintained as a single body responsible for both foreign affairs and internal management. Conduct of international diplomacy and the position of appellate court justice shall be the responsibility of the Alcuahtl, aided and advised by a National Council. The members of the National Council shall function as judges to arbitrate disputes in accordance with relevant laws, as well as legislators to propose and vote on legislation of national importance, and will also vote on the acceptance of treaties with foreign powers. The position of Alcuahtl will be a lifetime post, until resignation or inactivity, and the Alcuahtl will be succeeded by their appointed deputy. Council members will be elected to a finite term by the citizens of the nation.
